# Command Line Tools

A few tools have been wrapped for basic functionality in CWL. The descriptions are not exhaustive, but for the purposes of the tutorial will show how to wrap a few functions and use them together in a workflow

## Running

To run the workflow:

  1. Ensure the virtualenv is enabled with cwltools and cwl-runner installed
  2. Type the following command into the terminal
      `cwl-runner workflow/basic.cwl basic.yml`

To re-use this basic workflow modify basic.yml, or create a new one with the same parameters that `basic.cwl` takes.
